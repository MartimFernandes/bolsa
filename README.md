# bolsa
Bash script to quickly check the Brazilian stock market from terminal (IBOVESPA / B3).

This will work with typical tickers from B3 (BOVESPA), fractional tickers, real estate investment funds (FIIs) and even the index itself (IBOV).

Since it relies on a public API, it can sometimes return an empty answer or take a few seconds. It may also stop working without notice.
